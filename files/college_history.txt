***(HISTORY OF THE COLLEGE)*** 
Established in 1963, in the industrial town 
of Sivakasi, popularly known as 'Little Japan' in 
Tamil Nadu, the Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal 
College (Autonomous), Sivakasi, is a standing 
testimony to the wisdom and foresight of Late 
Thiru. P. Ayya Nadar, a leading businessman 
and pioneering industrialist of this town. As the 
Institution was established by his munificence, 
the college was fittingly named after him and 
his equally generous wife Late Thirumathi. 
A. Janaki Ammal. Intended to fulfil the long felt 
needs and aspirations of the people of Sivakasi 
and its suburbs, the college is nurtured and 
developed by the financial resources provided 
by two charitable trusts, viz., Janaki Ammal Ayya 
Nadar Trust and P. lya Nadar Charitable trust. 
Thiru. A. Grahadurai and Thiru. A. Vairaprakasam, 
the two elder sons of the Founder, continued 
to bring laurels to the institution by being the 
Secretary and the Correspondent of the College 
Committee in 1963, respectively, for well over 18 years 
from the very inception of the institution. 14 
In order to make use of the experience 
and ability of the other members of the College 
Committee, the posts of the President, the 
Secretary and the Correspondent of the College 
Committee are filled up by election, once in three 
years, from among the five members of the 
College Committee. 
Located in a campus sprawling over one 
hundred and fifty seven acres on the Sivakasi- 
Srivilliputtur road, five kilometers away from 
Sivakasi, the college has been serving as a 
beacon light in the backward area of 
Virudhunagar District. Emphasising teaching, 
learning and research programmes in different 
disciplines to the benefit of thousands of students 
who pursue higher education. Today, the Ayya 
Nadar Janaki Ammal College (Autonomous) is 
reckoned as one of the leading educational 
institutions in Tamil Nadu with diversified courses, 
excellent infrastructure, competent faculty and 
very promising students. The institution has 
registered steady academic growth right from 
its inception which could be understood on having 
a glimpse of the following details.

ECO PARK
This was perhaps a mega project launched on the eastern side of the main
 building in a barren land. Initially we planned to plant 500 plants. But
 Dr. V. Ganesan, H.O.D of Botany Department insisted me that we should go
 for planting 1000 trees. The proposal was submitted to our correspondent
 and was approved.
Mr. G. Athipathy advised me that forest trees be planted instead of
 conventional trees. Prof. K. Muthuchelian, who was then Professor of
 Energy Department of Madurai Kamaraj University, was kind enough in
 supplying about 400 grown up trees free of cost. Dr V. Ganesan, Head of
 the P.G. Department of Botany, Dr V. Pandiarajan and Dr K. Sankara
 Sivaraman took great efforts in collecting the young trees from
 different places.
Dr A. Johnson, Head of the P.H.S Department and Mr. P. Ganesan, Physical
 Director lent great service in preparing the lay out keeping the tree
 architecture in mind for planting the trees. I have to acknowledge at
 this juncture the enormous labour put forth by the students of P.H.S
 Department in digging 1000 pits manually during hot summer. Shri. A.
 Grahadurai President of the Management Committee, Shri. A.

 Mr. V. Ayyan kodiswaran and his wife Mrs. A. Niranjana Kodiswaran, Mr.
 G. Athipathy and his wife Mrs. A. Ahila Athipathy, Prof. Raju, N.S.S.
 Coordinator, Prof. Kailash Paliwal, School of Biological Sciences and
 Prof. K. Muthuchelian, School of Energy, Madurai Kamaraj University
 participated in the tree planting ceremony and planted the saplings.
It was with an intention of providing green environment and oxygen-rich
 air inside the campus and facilitating the rain-bearing clouds to pour
 out rains when they cross our campus, the project was chosen. The N.S.S.
 Units of our college took charge of rearing up the trees. ‘ANJAC ECO
 PARK’ is a pride and a green jewel in the crown of ANJAC. Shri. A.
 Grahadurai, President of College Management Committee inaugurated ANJAC
 ECO PARK on 15.10.2001.
Anjac Eco Park provides a serene atmosphere to the campus. It was
 heartening to note that our college received ‘Environmental Award’ from
 the Tamil Nadu State Government for the year 2001 - 2002.

 Organization The college administration is primarily governed by the managing committee, which includes members of the Ayya and Janaki Ammal Trust, the principal and university representatives.[5]Autonomous functionaries and the college council are responsible for the day-to-day activities of the academic programs. The two charitable Trusts, namely Ayya Nadar Janaki Ammal Trust and P. Iya Nadar Trust, manage the college and extend financial support. On average, they contribute Rs.50 lakhs annually. In 2004–2005 the contribution was Rs.88 lakhs for promoting various activities in the college. As an Autonomous college, the management adheres to decentralized governing practices and follows a democratic approach. The entire faculty is involved in decision-making at all levels. Faculty members contribute their expertise to major policy-making bodies such as the governing council and college committee, alongside the managing committee members, the Principal, university and government representatives. The Heads of Departments constitute the college council, with the Principal serving as the president. The council meets once a month. The Academic Council handles curriculum design, student admissions, and co-curricular and extracurricular activities. The College Council focuses on day-to-day administration and related matters. Departments have autonomy in decision-making at their level, and decisions are communicated to the management. The practice of bottom-up communication is followed. The college operates with a focus on its goals, vision, and mission, and has an organizational structure that effectively coordinates both academic and administrative planning. Being an autonomous institution, it has its own Board of Studies to prepare syllabi and a panel of examiners. 
The Finance Committee manages capital expenditure and annual accounts. The Planning and Evaluation Committee oversees campus discipline, teaching and learning, and welfare activities. The Awards Committee reviews examination results, maintains records, and forwards mark sheets and diplomas to the concerned authorities. The college has coordinators for the Curriculum Development Cell, Academic Affairs, and Student Services. There are separate controllers of examinations for UG and PG courses who conduct exams, set fees, schedule dates, administer terminal exams, and announce results. Under its organizational structure, ANJAC has established an Internal Quality Assurance Cell (IQAC). The primary task of IQAC is to develop a system for conscious, consistent, and catalytic improvement in institutional performance. It serves as a facilitative and participative unit of the institution, critically reviewing and assessing the performance of all departmental committees and cells. IQAC met four times during 2004–2005.Since the college is aided by the government, it follows the guidelines set by the Government of Tamil Nadu, the university, and the U.G.C. A sufficient number of faculty members are available in all departments, and the college is equipped with computers and Internet facilities for office automation. The main sources of finance are: grant-in-aid from the Tamil Nadu Government, the Central Government, student fees, and contributions by the management, U.G.C. assistance, self-financing courses, and other funding agencies. Academics [edit] Curriculum [edit] The College offers 17 subjects across 70 program combinations. Over the last five years, 16 new UG/PG courses, all under the self-funded category, have been introduced, including 6 IT-based courses.
 Additionally, a computer foundation program is offered to all non-computer students. Degree programs include inbuilt vocational modules, and newly started PG programs facilitate vertical mobility. This multidimensional development of the curriculum is beneficial to learners. Student feedback is obtained and processed formally. The curriculum revision process considers various inputs, including students' evaluations of programs, opinions from the Curriculum Development Cell, findings from departmental meetings, feedback from subject experts, alumni, and prospective employers. Curriculum reviews are conducted annually, with updates and minor changes made on a continuous basis. Major revisions occur once every three years for PG programs and once every four years for UG programs. Admission [edit] Students are admitted to the various UG courses based on a merit-cum-reservation policy, while 25% of the weightage for PG course admissions is given to entrance test scores. All seats in all courses are filled due to high demand. Degrees [edit] The academic programs offered cover most science and humanities streams.[6]Three-year undergraduate and two-year postgraduate programs are available in various disciplines. M.Phil. and Ph.D. degrees are awarded as part of the research program, with a relatively higher number in the Tamil discipline.[7]An undergraduate Bachelor’s program in Physical Education is offered for those interested in training to become professionals in sports. Exams [edit] Learners are assessed through continuous internal assessment (CIA) and terminal examinations. Double valuation of answer scripts is implemented for both UG and PG programs. For PG programs, internal and external assessments each carry 50% weightage. 
The internal assessment components include tests (30 marks), quizzes (5 marks), assignments (5 marks), and seminars (10 marks). For UG programs, internal assessment carries a 40% weightage. Complete transparency is maintained in the internal evaluation process. To build confidence in the evaluation system, valued answer scripts are returned to students for their scrutiny, and they are provided with an opportunity to raise any grievances. In case of disputes, a provision for revaluation is available. Examination conduct and valuation are centralized. Research the research cell established in the college fosters and sustains a research culture. Faculty members are motivated by providing a doctoral allowance of Rs.200 per month. Monetary assistance is also offered for publications in national and international journals, as well as for thesis preparation. Grants received from funding agencies are appreciated and rewarded. Teachers are encouraged to participate in seminars and present papers. Over the last five years, 24 teachers have received Ph.Ds. Out of 144 faculty members, 44 hold Ph.D. degrees. Additionally, 17 research scholars have received their Ph.D. during the last five years. The college is currently managing three major research projects funded by DST and DBT, with a total outlay of Rs.66.16 lakhs.
 Another ongoing research project funded by the Management is worth Rs.7 lakhs. Five major projects have been completed in the last five years. Of the 16 minor research projects sanctioned by the UGC during the same period, two are yet to be completed. The UGC has sanctioned Rs.100 lakhs under the CPE scheme. The presence of a research culture on campus builds confidence among faculty and students in independent inquiry. The college publishes a bi-annual scientific journal, ANJAC Journal of Science. Over the last five years, faculty members have published 64 papers in international journals, 215 papers in national journals, and 535 papers have been abstracted in various seminar proceedings. Transfer of knowledge and skills to industry and the local community has provided limited financial returns to the college. The Consultancy Cell publishes available expertise through circulars to various stakeholders. Some of the consultancy services offered include soil testing, water and soap analysis, mushroom cultivation, blood group identification and testing, bio-compost preparation, and disease diagnosis.

Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. Find sources :"Undergraduate education"–news· newspapers· books· scholar· JSTOR(August 2020)(Learn how and when to remove this message)Pomona College in Claremont , California, a liberal arts college offering undergraduate education Undergraduate education is education conducted after secondary education and before postgraduate education, usually in a college or university. It typically includes all postsecondary programs up to the level of a bachelor's degree. For example, in the United States, a student pursuing an associate or bachelor's degree is known as an under graduate student while a student pursuing a master's or doctoral degree is a graduate student. Upon completion of courses and other requirements of an under graduate program, the student would earn the corresponding degree. In some other educational systems, undergraduate education is postsecondary education up to and including the level of a master’s degree; this is the case for some science courses in Britain and some medicine courses in Europe. By country Africa Nigeria In Nigeria, undergraduate degrees (excluding Medicine, Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Engineering, Law and Architecture) are four-year-based courses. Medicine (MBBS) and Architecture normally take six years to complete studies while Medical Laboratory Science, Nursing, Law and Engineering courses take five years to complete studies, usually, all six years are taken to improve their chances. Undergraduate nursing degrees or diplomas usually take two to four years and sometimes 5 years to complete, whereas graduate degrees are an additional two years or more.
 South Africa[edit] In South Africa, the undergraduate system usually has a three-year undergraduate bachelor's degree, with two or three majors. (There are exceptions, such as the medical qualification (MBChB), which is six years, and Engineering which is four.) A fourth year, known as an Honours year, is considered a post-graduate degree. It is usually course-driven, although may include a project or thesis. Americas[edit]Brazil[edit]See also: Universities and Higher Education in Brazil Federal University of Ciaran Ciara, Brazil  follows the major traits of the continental European system; free public schools are available from kindergarten up to post graduation, both as a right established in Article 6,caputof the Brazilian Constitution and as a duty of the State in Article 208, Items I, IV and V, of the Brazilian Constitution.[1]Students choose their specific course of studies before joining the university. Admission to university is obtained by means of a competitive entrance exam known as Vestibular(a concept somewhat similar to the Baccalaureates France). A later system introduced in 2009, adopted by most federal universities, uses the high school national examination (ENEM) result as part or a replacement of the Vestibular grade.[2]Depending on the chosen course, upon graduating the student is granted: a technologist diploma, three years to complete, a bachelor's degree's diploma, which usually takes four or, in the case of Law, Veterinary, Geology and Engineering, five years to complete; or a professional diploma, which normally require five or, in the case of medicine, six years to complete. United States[edit]See also: Higher education in the United States The University of Virginia, founded in 1819 by Thomas Jefferson in Charlottesville, Virginia In the United States, undergraduate education refers to a student who is studying for a bachelor's degree.
The most common bachelor's degrees are Bachelor of Arts (BA/AB) and Bachelor of Science (BS/SB), but other degrees such as Bachelor of Fine Arts (BFA), Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Bachelor of Music (BM), Bachelor of Social Work (BSW), Bachelor of Engineering/Bachelor of Science in Engineering (BEng/BSE), Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN), Bachelor of Business Administration/Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BBA/BSBA), Bachelor of Education (B. Ed), Bachelor of Liberal Arts (BLA/ALB), and Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) are also possible. Most commonly these degrees require four years of full-time study after high school. An additional accolade to the bachelor's degree is the Honours degree. Unlike in the British model, degrees in law and medicine are not offered at the undergraduate level and instead are completed at a graduate level, after earning a bachelor's degree. Neither field specifies or prefers any undergraduate major,[citation needed]though medical schools require a set of courses that must be taken before enrolment.[4]Students can also choose to attend a two-year community college before further study at a four-year college or university. In most states, community colleges are operated either by a division of the state university or by local special districts subject to guidance from a state agency. Community colleges award associate degrees of different types, some intended to prepare students to transfer to four-year institutions (e.g. Associate of Arts (AA), Associate of Science (AS)), and others intended to provide vocational skills and training for students wishing to enter into or advance in a profession. In some states considerable attention has been given to make sure that community college courses in fact prepare the students for the continuation courses they will encounter at the local college; this process of bringing courses into sequence is called articulation. Some community colleges have automatic enrolment agreements with a local college or university, where the community college provides the first two years of study and the university provides the remaining years of study, sometimes all on one campus. 
The community colleges award associate degrees, while universities and colleges award the bachelor's. However, some community colleges, such as Bravo sport College in Lake Jackson, Texas offer bachelor's degrees along with associate degrees.[5]Conversely, some universities such as the University of Delaware also award associate degrees.[6]In the United States, "college" and "university" are terms used differently in different states; New York's terminology is especially confusing (see University of the State of New York). A university is usually larger than a college, and has programs at the graduate level, but the distinction is not clear-cut. Some colleges (like Smith College) award graduate degrees, for example, and some colleges are larger than some universities. Some states have requirements a college must meet before it is allowed to call itself a university. Institutions seeking to grow have pursued various steps to turn two-year junior colleges into community colleges, community colleges into four-year colleges, awarding baccalaureate degrees, sometimes while still a community college, and colleges into universities, with graduate (post-baccalaureate) programs. Asia[edit]Bangladesh[edit]In Bangladesh, three-year undergraduate programs are known as Degree (Pass) courses and four-year undergraduate programs are known as Honours courses.[7]Hong Kong[edit] The University of Hong Kong In Hong Kong, the English system is followed. Students sit for the Certificate of Education examinations at around sixteen years of age, and the Advanced-level, or A-level examinations at around eighteen, then follow by three years of undergraduate education, except for a few specific fields, such as medicine, nursing and law. This is due to be changed, with five-year secondary education and two-year matriculation examination combined and shortened to six years matriculation, and undergraduate education lengthened to four years. Students may be able to receive general education in their first years in universities, more akin to the North American system. 
The first batch of students under the new system will enter universities in 2012.Alternatives are undergraduate certificates or diplomas, with some equivalent to associate degree in educational level. India University of Madras in Chennai, India's higher education system is the third largest in the world, next to the United States and China. The main governing body at the tertiary level is the University Grants Commission, which enforces its standards, advises the government, and helps coordinate between the centre and the state. Accreditation for higher learning is overseen by 15 autonomous institutions established by the University Grants Commission (UGC).In India, the graduation system is classified into two parts: Undergraduate (UG) and Postgraduate (PG). It takes three or four years to complete an undergraduate degree. The three-year undergraduate programs are mostly in the fields of arts, commerce, science etc., and the four-year programs are mostly in the fields of technology, engineering, pharmaceutical sciences, agriculture etc. However, for medicine, law and architecture, the period has been five years.[8]The possessor of the first UG is referred to as graduate and that of the PG degree as post-graduate.[9][10]Other than UG and PG there are various 1 to 2 year diploma courses available. Indian higher education system has expanded at a fast pace by adding nearly 20,000 colleges and more than 8 million students in a decade from 2000–01 to 2010–11. As of 2020, India has over 1000 universities, with a break up of 54central universities, 416state universities, 125deemed universities, 361private universities, 7Institute under State Legislature Act, and 159Institutes of National Importance which include IIMs, AIIMS, IITs, IIITs, IISERs and NITs among others. Other institutions include 52,627 colleges as government degree colleges, private colleges, standalone institutes and post-graduate research institutions, functioning under these universities as reported by the MHRD in 2020. Colleges may be Autonomous, i.e. empowered to examine their own degrees, up to PhD level in some cases, or non-autonomous, in which case their examinations are under the supervision of the university to which they are affiliated; in either case, however, degrees are awarded in the name of the university rather than the college.
 Japan Main article: Higher education in Japan Undergraduate education in Japan requires four years, which is divided into two stages; associate degree's level first-half two years and bachelor's level second-half two years. Bachelor's degrees are awarded only by universities and NIAD-QE. Pakistan[edit]Main article: Education in Pakistan The University of the Punjab in Lahore, Pakistan In Pakistan, it generally requires four years to complete a Bachelor's degree in Arts, Sciences, Dentistry, Engineering or Business Administration such as BA,BS,BDS,BE/BS/BSc Engineering or BBA and five years for bachelor's degrees in medicine (MBBS), Physiotherapy (DPT), Pharmacy (D. Pharm) and Architecture (B.Arch.) after successfully completing 12 years of schooling. 4 years bachelor's degree is offered in various universities of Pakistan such as COMSATS Institute of Information Technology(CIIT),University of Engineering and Technology, Lahore(UET Lahore),University of Engineering and Technology, Taxila (UET Taxila),National University of Sciences and Technology(NUST),Lahore University of Management Sciences(LUMS) and National University of Computer and Emerging Sciences(NU).The modern educational system comprises the following five stages: The Primary school acting five years for children 5–10 years old in grades one to five; a Middle school of three years for children 10 to 13 years old, covering grades six through eight; a two-year secondary, or Matriculation consists of grades nine and ten, for children 13 to 15 years old; a two-year higher secondary, or Intermediate college, leading to anF.A.in arts orF.Sc.in science; and a fifth stage covering college and university programs leading to baccalaureate, professional, master's and doctorate degrees. 
The pre-primary or preparatory classes, called cache (literally, unripe) or Nursery school, were formally integrated into the education system in 1988.Europe[edit]England, Northern Ireland, and Wales[edit]Main article: British undergraduate degree classification Students in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland may usually enter university from the age of eighteen, often having studied A-levels and thus having had thirteen to fifteen years of schooling. Occasionally students who finish A Level or equivalent qualifications early (after skipping a year in school on the grounds of academic giftedness) may enter below this age but large universities are now setting minimum age limits of 16 or 17 after a number of well publicised "child prodigies" were found to be emotionally and mentally unprepared for university life.[citation needed]Applications for undergraduate courses in UK higher education are made through the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service(UCAS).[11]For their first degree, most students read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes three years; however, in the sciences and engineering, integrated courses covering both undergraduate level and advanced degree level leading to the degree of master,[12]usually taking four years and including a research project or dissertation, are popular. Given the integrated nature of these programs someone who gains a master's degree via an integrated program is not usually admitted to the degree of bachelor. 
Master’s degrees conferred after extended programs are not to be conflated with the degree of Master of Arts conferred at Oxbridge and Dublin, which is not a substantive qualification, but reflects the ancient practice of those three universities of promoting Bachelors of Arts to Masters of Arts (and thus full membership of the university) six or seven years after matriculation.[12]Honours degrees and integrated master's degrees are awarded with1st, upper 2nd, lower 2nd or 3rd class honours. If a student passes the course but fails to do so sufficiently well for third class honours to be awarded he will be awarded with an ordinary degree. It is possible to use the abbreviation "Hons" after the degree post nominal to indicate that the degree has been passed with honours and is not an ordinary degree. Many universities offers and which courses or an extramural year, which offer work placements for a short period of time in a relevant industry before students complete their studies. 
Taking a sandwich course may make the course last a year longer than it would otherwise. With very few exceptions, nearly all universities with the power to award degrees are heavily state financed. However, they also rely on tuition fees set by the government at a maximum index-linked level, repayable after graduation contingent on attaining a certain level of income, and with the state paying all fees for students from the poorest backgrounds. UK students are generally entitled to student loans for maintenance with repayment contingent on income.[13]Unlike in other European countries, the British government does not own the universities' assets and university staff are not civil servants. United Kingdom universities are therefore better described as autonomous, intellectually-independent institutions with public funding, rather than public universities per se. The crown does not control syllabi, with the exception of teacher training. The crown restricts the power to award degrees to those with a royal charter, in the case of traditional universities, or authorization from the Secretary of State for Universities, in the case of modern universities. Universities accredited in foreign countries, such as Richmond University are, however, free to operate. European Bologna systems[edit]Main article: Bologna process In many countries, the English distinction between a bachelor's and master's degree is being introduced by the Bologna process. Under the new Bologna reform, universities in Europe are introducing the Bachelor level (BA or BS) degree, often by dividing a five-year Master-level program into two parts (three-year Bachelor's + two-year Master's)
 where students are not obligated to continue with the second Master's-degree part. These new bachelor's degrees are similar in structure to British bachelor's degrees. If there is a separate undergraduate degree, higher degrees (License, Master, Doctorate) can be gained after completing the undergraduate degree. In the traditional German system, there were no undergraduate degrees in some fields, such as engineering: students continued to Master's level education without any administrative breakpoints, and employers would not consider half-finished master's degrees. The Bachelor's phase in The Netherlands can be fulfilled either at university or at a university of applied sciences. These two institutions differ from each other in the level students learn abstract concepts. Education at universities is aimed at research and fundamental principles while at universities of applied sciences it concentrates on applying knowledge in a vocation.[14]Universities of applied sciences typically do not offer master and PhD programs. Scotland[edit]Students in Scotland usually enter university in the year they turn eighteen, with many starting at seventeen; courses take a year longer than in the rest of the UK. At the older universities the degree of Master of Arts is conferred in the arts subjects after four years while the newer universities instead confer the degree of Bachelor of Arts. The degree of Master of Arts conferred by the Ancient Scottish Universities is equivalent to the degree of Bachelor of Arts at other universities and does not require the level of study necessitated for the other degrees of master awarded by these universities. The degree instead reflects the ancient traditions of these universities.[12]In the sciences, students usually read for the degree of bachelor, which usually takes four years.
 However, as with the rest of the UK, integrated master's degrees are popular in science and engineering, although in Scotland they last for five years. Degree classification is the same as in the rest of UK. Other European systems[edit]In many other, particularly continental European systems, an "undergraduate" degree in the American sense does not exist. Because students are expected to have received a sound general education at the secondary level, in a school such as a gymnasium or lychee, students in Europe enrol in a specific course of studies they wish to pursue upon entry into a university. In the US, students only specialize in a "major" during the last years of college. Specializing in a field of study upon entry into a university means most students graduate after four to five years of study. The fields available include those only taught as graduate degrees in the US, such as law or medicine. In the traditional system of Germany, there is a vocational degree (diplomaFH) that is similar in length, and is also considered an academic degree. Though it is designed as a specialist degree, in contrast to the Diploma degree at university, which claims to be more generalist. Germany itself, however, is currently abolishing the legal distinction between Foch Hoch school and university. They are both translated as university and they both provide bologna-compliant and equivalent postgraduate degrees.[15]Not obligatory and sometimes applied at universities in the Netherlands are the propaedeutic exams. The entire curriculum of the first two semesters of the bachelor's programme is part of the propaedeutic exams. In most bachelor's studies, students are required to obtain their propaedeutic certificate within three semesters after starting the course. A propaedeutic certificate also counts as a requirement for participating in a university level bachelor's study.
 The propaedeutic exams have the purpose of assessing whether a student has the appropriate capacities in order to complete the course. At some Swedish universities (such as the Royal Institute of Technology), PhD courses are sometimes referred to as "graduate courses", whereas courses for other students (up to master level) sometimes are referred to as "undergraduate courses". The system at many Finnish universities is similar. In the French system, the first degree of tertiary education was reached two years after the baccalaureate. Amongst these degrees the university-delivered DEUG has disappeared, where as Diploma universities de technologies, Brevet de Technician Superiors or classes preparatory aux grandees colas still exist. According to the Bologna process, this two-year curriculum will be replaced by the three-year licence, yet existing. See also  Look up undergrad in Wiktionary, the free dictionary.

Graduate degrees can include master's and doctoral degrees, and other qualifications such as graduate diplomas, certificates and professional degrees. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which can include medical school, law school, business school, and other institutions of specialized fields such as nursing, speech–language pathology, engineering, or architecture.
 The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute since various professional schools offer graduate degrees and vice versa. Producing original research is a significant component of graduate studies in the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. This research typically leads to the writing and defines of a thesis or dissertation. In graduate programs that are oriented toward professional training (e.g., MPA, MBA, JD, MD), the degrees may consist solely of coursework, without an original research or thesis component. Graduate students in the humanities, sciences and social sciences often receive funding from their university (e.g., fellowships or scholarships) or a teaching assistant position or other job; in the profession-oriented grad programs, students are less likely to get funding, and the fees are typically much higher. Although graduate school programs are distinct from undergraduate degree programs, graduate instruction (in the US, Australia, and other countries) is often offered by some of the same senior academic staff and departments who teach undergraduate courses. Unlike in undergraduate programs, however, it is less common for graduate students to take coursework outside their specific field of study at graduate or graduate entry level. 
At the doctorate programs, though, it is quite common for students to take courses from a wider range of study, for which some fixed portion of coursework, sometimes known as residency, is typically required to be taken from outside the department and university of the degree-seeking candidate to broaden the research abilities of the student. Types of postgraduate qualification[edit]There are two main types of degrees studied for at the postgraduate level: academic and vocational degrees. Degrees[edit]The term degree in this context means the moving from one stage or level to another and first appeared in the 13th century. History[edit]The entry of students in the Nation Germania Bonhomie, the nation of German students at the University of Bologna, depicted in a 1497 image Although systems of higher education date back to ancient India, ancient Greece, ancient Rome and ancient China, the concept of postgraduate education depends upon the system of awarding degrees at different levels of study, and can be traced to the workings of European medieval universities, mostly Italian.[4][5]University studies took six years for a bachelor's degree and up to twelve additional years for a master's degree or doctorate. 
The first six years taught the faculty of the arts, which was the study of the seven liberal arts: arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, music theory, grammar, logic, and rhetoric. The main emphasis was on logic. Once a Bachelor of Arts degree had been obtained, the student could choose one of three faculties—law, medicine, or theology—in which to pursue master's or doctor's degrees. The degrees of master (from Latin magister) and doctor (from Latin doctor) were for some time equivalent, "the former being more in favour at Paris and the universities modelled after it, and the latter at Bologna[6]and its derivative universities. At Oxford and Cambridge a distinction came to be drawn between the Faculties of Law, Medicine, and Theology and the Faculty of Arts in this respect, the title of Doctor being used for the former, and that of Master for the latter."[7]Because theology was thought to be the highest of the subjects, the doctorate came to be thought of as higher than the master's.[note 1]The main significance of the higher, postgraduate degrees was that they licensed the holder to teach. Definition[edit]In most countries, the hierarchy of postgraduate degrees is as follows: Master's degrees. These are sometimes placed in a further hierarchy, starting with degrees such as the Master of Arts(from Latin Magister atrium; M.A.) and Master of Science(from Latin Magister scientiae; M.Sc.) degrees, then the Master of Philosophy degree (from Latin Magister philosophise; M.Phil.), and finally the Master of Letters degree (from Latin Magister litter arum; M.Litt.) (all formerly known in France as DEA or DESS before 2005, and nowadays Masters too). In the UK, master's degrees may be taught or by research: taught master's degrees include the Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees which last one year and are worth 180CATScredits (equivalent to 90 ECTS European credits[9]), whereas the master's degrees by research include the Master of Research degree (M.Res.) which also lasts one year and is worth 180 CATS or 90 ECTS credits (the difference compared to the Master of Science and Master of Arts degrees being that the research is much more extensive) and the Master of Philosophy degree which lasts two years. In Scottish Universities, the Master of Philosophy degree tends to be by research or higher master's degree and the Master of Letters degree tends to be the taught or lower master's degree.
 In many fields such as clinical social work, or library science in North America, a master's is the terminal degree. Professional degrees such as the Master of Architecture degree (M.Arch.) can last to three and a half years to satisfy professional requirements to be an architect. Professional degrees such as the Master of Business Administration degree (M.B.A.) can last up to two years to satisfy the requirement to become a knowledgeable business leader.[10]Doctorates. These are often further divided into academic and professional doctorates. An academic doctorate can be awarded as a Doctor of Philosophy degree (from Latin Doctor philosophise; Ph.D. or D.Phil.), a Doctor of Psychology The Australian grades are divided into four categories: High Distinction, Distinction, Credit, and Pass (though many institutions have idiosyncratic grading systems). Assessment and evaluation based on the Australian system is not equivalent to British or US schemes because of the "low-marking" scheme used by Australian universities. For example, a British student who achieves 70+ will receive an A grade, whereas an Australian student with 70+ will receive a Distinction which is not the highest grade in the marking scheme.Funding[edit]The Australian government usually offer full funding (fees and a monthly stipend) to its citizens and permanent residents who are pursuing research-based higher degrees. There are also highly competitive scholarships for international candidates who intend to pursue research-based programmes. Taught-degree scholarships (certain master's degrees, Grad. Dip., Grad. Cert., D.Eng., D.B.A.) are almost non-existent for international students. Domestic students have access to tuition subsidy through the Australian Government's FEE-Help loan scheme. Some students may be eligible for a Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP), via the HECS-Help scheme, at a substantially lower cost.[30]Degree requirements[edit]Requirements for the successful completion of a taught master's programme are that the student pass all the required modules. Some universities require eight taught modules for a one-year programme, twelve modules for a one-and-a-half-year programme, and twelve taught modules plus a thesis or dissertation for a two-year programme. The academic year for an Australian postgraduate programme is typically two semesters (eight months of study).Requirements for research-based programmes vary among universities. Generally, however, a student is not required to take taught modules as part of their candidacy. It is now common that first-year Ph.D. candidates are not regarded as permanent Ph.D. students for fear that they may not be sufficiently prepared to undertake independent research. In such cases, an alternative degree will be awarded for their previous work, usually an M.Phil. or M.Sc.
 There are over 300 doctoral programs that collaborate with 1200 research laboratories and centres. Each degree has a certain set of national diplomas that are all of equal value, irrespective of where they were issued. There are also other diplomas that are exclusive to France and are very hard to attain. Admission to a doctoral program requires a master's degree, both research-oriented and disciplinary focused. High marks are required (typically tares being honour, equating a cum laude), but the acceptance is linked to a decision of the School Academicals Board. Germany[edit]See also: List of graduate schools, German Universities Excellence Initiative The traditional and most common way of obtaining a doctorate in Germany is by doing so individually under supervision of a single professor (Doctorate or Doctorate) without any formal curriculum. During their studies, doctoral students are enrolled at university while often being employed simultaneously either at the university itself, at a research institute or at a company as a researcher.[39]Working in research during doctoral studies is, however, not a formal requirement. With the establishment of Gaudier ten killers funded, the German Research Foundation, in the early 1990s, the concept of a graduate school was introduced to the German higher education system. Unlike the American model of graduate schools, only doctoral students participate in a Graduiertenkolleg. In contrast to the traditional German model of doctoral studies, a Graduiertenkollegaims to provide young researchers with a structured doctoral training under supervision of a team of professors within an excellent research environment. A Graduiertenkollegtypically consists of 20-30 doctoral students, about half of whom are supported by stipends from the DFG or another sponsor. The research programme is usually narrowly defined around a specific topic and has an interdisciplinary aspect. The programme is set up for a specific period of time (up to nine years if funded by the DFG). The official English translation of the term Gaudier ten killer is Research Training Group. In 2006, a different type of graduate school, termed Gaudier ten schooled("graduate school"), was established by the DFG as part of the German Universities Excellence Initiative. 
They are thematically much broader than the focused Gaudier ten killers and consist often of 100-200 doctoral students. Germany and the Netherlands introduced the Bologna process with a separation between Bachelor and Master programmes in many fields, except for education studies, law and other specially regulated subjects. Ireland[edit]In the Republic of Ireland higher education is operated by the Higher Education Authority. Nigeria[edit]Admission to a postgraduate degree programme in Nigeria requires a bachelor's degree with at least a Second Class Lower Division (not less than 2.75/5). Admission to Doctoral programmes requires an Academic master's degree with a minimum weighted average of 60% (B average or 4.00/5). In addition to this, applicants may be subjected to written and oral examinations depending on the school. Most universities with high numbers of applicants have more stringent admission processes.[40]Postgraduate degrees in Nigeria include M.A., M.Sc., M.Ed., M. Eng., LL.M, M. Arch., M. Agric., M.Phil., PhD. The master's degree typically take 18–36 months with students undertaking coursework and presenting seminars and a dissertation. The doctoral degree is for a minimum of 36 months and may involve coursework alongside the presentation of seminars and a research thesis. Award of postgraduate degrees requires a defence of the completed research before a panel of examiners comprising external and internal examiners, Head of Department, Departmental Postgraduate Coordinator, Representative(s) of Faculty and Postgraduate School, and any other member of staff with a PhD in the department/faculty. United Kingdom[edit]The term "graduate school" is used more widely by North American universities than by those in the UK. However, in addition to universities set up solely for postgraduate studies such as Cranfield University, numerous universities in the UK have formally launched 'Graduate Schools', including the University of Birmingham, Durham University, Keeley University, the University of Nottingham, Bournemouth University, Queen's University Belfast and the University of London, which includes graduate schools at King's College London, Royal Holloway and University College London. 
They often coordinate the supervision and training of candidates for research master's programmes and for doctorates. Admission[edit]Admission to undertake a research degree in the UK typically requires a strong bachelor's degree or Scottish M.A. (at least lower second, but usually an upper second or first class). In some institutions, doctoral candidates are initially admitted to a Masters in Research Philosophy (M.Phil. or M.Res.), then later transfer to a Ph.D./D.Phil. if they can show satisfactory progress in their first 8–12 months of study.[41]Candidates for the degree of Doctor of Education  (Pd.D.) are typically required to hold a good bachelor's degree as well as an appropriate master's degree before being admitted. Funding[edit]Funding for postgraduate study in the UK is awarded competitively, and usually is disseminated by institution (in the form of a certain allocation of studentships for a given year) rather than directly to individuals. There are a number of scholarships for master's courses, but these are relatively rare and dependent on the course and class of undergraduate degree obtained (usually requiring at least a lower second). Most master's students are self-funded. Funding is available for some Ph.D./D.Phil. courses. As at the master's level, there is more funding available to those in the sciences than in other disciplines. Such funding generally comes from Research Councils such as the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council(EPSRC),Arts and Humanities Research Council(AHRC),Medical Research Council(MRC) and others. Masters students may also have the option of a Postgraduate loan introduced by the UK Government in 2016.For overseas students, most major funding applications are due as early as twelve months or more before the intended graduate course will begin. This funding is also often highly competitive. The most widely available, and thus important, award for overseas students is the Overseas Research Student (ORS) Award, which pays the difference in university fees between an overseas student and a British or EU resident.
 However, a student can only apply for one university for the ORS Award, often before they know whether they have been accepted. As of the 2009/2010 academic year, the HEFCE has cancelled the Overseas Research Student Award scheme for English and Welsh universities.[42]The state of the scheme for Scottish and Northern Irish universities is currently unclear. Full-time students (of any type) are not normally eligible for state benefits, including during vacation time.[43]United States[edit]Admission[edit]While most graduate programs will have a similar list of general admission requirements, the importance placed on each type of requirement can vary drastically between graduate schools, departments within schools, and even programs within departments. The best way to determine how a graduate program will weigh admission materials is to ask the person in charge of graduate admissions at the particular program being applied to. These differences are due to the differing nature of research between the humanities and some social sciences and the natural sciences and to the differing expectations of the discipline in coursework, languages, and length of dissertation. However, time required to complete a doctorate also varies according to the candidate's abilities and choice of research. 
Some students may also choose to remain in a program if they fail to win an academic position, particularly in disciplines with a tight job market; by remaining a student, they can retain access to libraries and university facilities, while also retaining an academic affiliation, which can be essential for conferences and job-searches. After the doctorate degree, a second training period is available for students in fields such as life sciences, called a postdoctoral fellowship. Funding[edit]In general, there is less funding available to students admitted to master's degrees than for students admitted to Ph.D. or other doctoral degrees. Many departments, especially those in which students have research or teaching responsibilities, offer tuition-forgiveness and a stipend that pays for most expenses. At some elite universities, there may be a minimum stipend established for all Ph.D. students, as well as a tuition waiver. The terms of these stipends vary greatly, and may consist of a scholarship or fellowship, followed by teaching responsibilities. At many elite universities, these stipends have been increasing, in response both to student pressure and, especially, to competition among the elite universities for graduate students.
